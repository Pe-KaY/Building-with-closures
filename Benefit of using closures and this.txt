Memory Efficiency:
closures can be used to create functions with private state that are memory efficient, 
as they only keep the necessary variables in memory

Reusability and Modularity:
components created with closures and this are highly reusable and modular. They can be instantiated multiple times with different configurations without
interfering with each other.

Dynamic Context Binding with this:
using this allows you to dynamically bind methods to the object instances,
making the methods flexible and reusable across different contexts.

Avoiding Global Variables:
by using closures, you avoid polluting the global namespace with variables,
reducing the risk of naming conflicts and making the code more maintainable


Encapsulation and State Management:
closures allow you to encapsulate the internal state of a component, 
ensuring that the state is only accessible and modifiable through the component's methods.
 This promotes better modularity and data hiding.
